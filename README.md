# Fuji-Llama 
This is a Llama Card game server written in GO. 
This is my first project in GO and all the server code is lifted from Eric Carr's work on 5 card stud and Fujitzee, 

so far I've just cloned his original reposisory 

to try and understand how the GO works and Eric server code etc I first started with writting the Llama game as
a standalone game, you can find this in the Llama folder. 

This you can just run that and play Llama in your terminal program as 1 player against up to 5 AI bots

The eventual goal is to make this a Fuji-net game and be hosted on a server somewhere and availabe in Fuji-net game lobby 
and be playable on multiply diffrent 8 bit computers

I'm an Atarian, so will be writing the client for the Atari 8 bit computers first and hopefully 
someone else will decide to write it for other platforms as time goes on.
